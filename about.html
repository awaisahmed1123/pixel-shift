        <h1>About Pixel Shift</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Pixel Shift! Our mission is to provide a powerful, fast, and completely private suite of image processing tools accessible to everyone, directly within their web browser. We believe that professional-grade image manipulation shouldn't require expensive software installations or compromise your data privacy.</p>

        <h2>Privacy First</h2>
        <p>In an era where data privacy is crucial, Pixel Shift stands apart. We designed this tool with a "privacy-first" approach. Every operation – converting, compressing, resizing, filtering, and watermarking – happens entirely on your device. <strong>Your images are never uploaded to any server.</strong> What you process stays with you.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>

            <li><strong>Format Conversion:</strong> Easily switch between JPG, PNG, and WEBP.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Quality Compression:</strong> Reduce file sizes significantly while maintaining visual quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Precise Resizing:</strong> Define exact dimensions in pixels.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative Filters:</strong> Apply various filters to enhance your images.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Watermarking:</strong> Protect your work with text or logo watermarks, including font choices, opacity, size, and position controls.</li>
        </ul>
