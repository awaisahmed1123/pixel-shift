        <h1>Privacy Policy for Pixel Shift</h1>
        <p><em>Effective Date: October 18, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Pixel Shift ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Pixel Shift web application (the "Service").</p>
        <p>Our core principle is <strong>privacy by design</strong>. Pixel Shift is built to ensure that your images and personal data remain entirely under your control and are never transmitted to us or any third party through the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Pixel Shift <strong>does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data or image files</strong> from its users. We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the Service.</p>

        <h2>3. Client-Side Processing</h2>
        <p>All image processing functionalities offered by Pixel Shift (including but not limited to converting, compressing, resizing, applying filters, and watermarking) occur <strong>entirely within your web browser</strong> on your own device ("client-side").</p>
        <p>The images you select for processing are <strong>never uploaded to our servers or any external server</strong>. They remain locally on your computer throughout the entire process.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>Pixel Shift <strong>does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies</strong> (like pixels or web beacons) to identify users, track usage patterns, or collect analytics data related to your interaction with the image processing tools.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Pixel Shift utilizes certain third-party libraries hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to provide its functionality (e.g., JSZip for creating zip files, browser-image-compression for image compression) and Google Fonts for typography. While these external resources are loaded into your browser, Pixel Shift does not share your images or any personal data with these third-party providers. Your interaction with these resources may be subject to the privacy policies of the respective providers (e.g., Google Fonts).</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since no image data or personal information is ever transmitted to or stored by Pixel Shift, the security of your data primarily relies on the security measures of your own device and web browser. We do not have access to your files at any point.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Pixel Shift is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
